# Supported datapoints

| Datapoint | Name | Description | Common uses | Interpretation of data | Data format |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| ndvi | Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) | Measures the greenness of vegetation. Higher values indicate healthier, denser vegetation. | Crop monitoring, forest management, vegetation health assessment. | Values closer to 1 indicate healthy, dense vegetation (e.g., green forests). Values closer to -1 indicate bare soil or water bodies. Values near 0 suggest sparse or unhealthy vegetation. | `float` with range from `-1.00` to `1.00` |
| evi | Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) | An improved version of NVDI that is less sensitive to atmospheric effects and soil background. | Crop stress detection, vegetation monitoring in arid regions. | Similar to NDVI, but less sensitive to atmospheric effects and soil background. Higher values generally indicate healthier vegetation. | `float` with range from `-1.00` to `1.00` |
| ndwi | Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) | Measures the presence of water bodies. Higher values indicate more water. | Water resource management, flood mapping, wetland monitoring. | Values closer to 1 indicate water bodies (e.g., lakes, rivers). Values closer to -1 indicate land areas. Values near 0 suggest mixed land-water areas. | `float` with range from `-1.00` to `1.00` |
| ndmi | Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) | Measures the presence of moisture in vegetation. Higher values indicate more moisture. | CAgricultural drought monitoring, vegetation stress assessment. | Values closer to 1 indicate areas with high moisture content (e.g., wetlands, dense vegetation). Values closer to -1 indicate dry areas. Values near 0 suggest moderate moisture content. | `float` with range from `-1.00` to `1.00` |
| savi | Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) | Adjusts for soil background effects, making it more suitable for areas with bare soil. | Crop monitoring in areas with bare soil, vegetation health assessment in arid regions. | Similar to NDVI but adjusted for soil background effects. Higher values indicate healthier vegetation, even in areas with bare soil. | `float` with range from `-1.00` to `1.00` |
| msavi | Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) | An improved version of SAVI that provides a wider dynamic range. | Similar to SAVI, but more sensitive to changes in vegetation conditions. | Similar to SAVI, but with a wider dynamic range. Higher values indicate healthier vegetation. | `float` with range from `-1.00` to `1.00` |
| gndvi | Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) | Focuses on the green band of the spectrum, providing a more specific measure of green vegetation. | Monitoring green vegetation cover, assessing plant health in agricultural and forestry applications. | Specifically measures green vegetation. Higher values indicate more green vegetation, while lower values suggest other vegetation types or bare soil. | `float` with range from `-1.00` to `1.00` |
| ccci | Canopy Chlorophyll Content Index (CCCI) | A vegetation index specifically designed to estimate the chlorophyll content of plant canopies. It incorporates algorithms to reduce the influence of soil reflectance, providing a more accurate estimate of chlorophyll content. | Assessing plant health, vegetation stress, and ecosystem dynamics. | Higher values generally indicate higher chlorophyll content in plant canopies. Lower values suggest lower chlorophyll content or other factors affecting vegetation health. | `float` with range from `-1.00` to `1.00` |
| nbr | Normalized Different NIR/SWIR Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) | Detects areas affected by fires. Higher values indicate burned areas. | Fire mapping, post-fire recovery monitoring, assessing fire severity. | Values closer to 1 indicate burned areas. Values closer to -1 indicate unburned areas. Values near 0 suggest mixed areas with both burned and unburned regions. | `float` with range from `-1.00` to `1.00` |
